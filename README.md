Users have access to records in PSQuery through the Query Access Manager.  Records are assigned to Query security trees.  However, finding the bigger picture of what records a user has access to through many roles and permission lists is somewhat daunting.  Just as difficult, questions about which roles and permission lists have access to a specific record can be a trip down the multiple rabbit holes.

Iâ€™ve created a few PSQiueries and SQL statements to help clarify the current relationships between the Records, Roles and Users. Hopefully these can help you adjust security in your implementation so your PSQuery users have correct record access.
